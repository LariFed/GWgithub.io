The first part provides an introduction to the Langlands correspondence from an arithmetical point of view. The second part gives enough background in geometric representation theory to understand Bezrukavnikov's equivalence, which is a categorification of Kazhdan and Lusztig's two realizations of the affine Hecke algebra.

          <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05432">Localized calculus for the Hecke category</a><br> Joint with Ben Elias<br> Our joint paper "Soergel calculus" (see below) contains a gap, which was pointed out by Simon Riche. (This gap doesn't effect any of the applications of Soergel calculus. It only shows up when using exotic realizations.) This paper fixes this gap, by proving the existence of a functor from the Hecke category to a groupoid built from the underlying Coxeter group. This functor provides an abstract realisation the localization of the Hecke category at the field of fractions. Knowing explicit formulas for the localization is a key technical tool in software for computations with Soergel bimodules.

            <br>Joint with Joshua Ciappara.<br>
        These are based on notes (taken by Josh) of some lectures I gave
            last August at the Simons Centre in Stony Brook. The subject is the modular representation
            theory of algebraic groups. This subject can be difficult to
            penetrate. The goal of these notes is to move quickly to the
            frontiers of research, with the hope that the interested reader
            can orient themselves at the front.

            We refine an idea of Deodhar, whose goal is a counting formula for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. This is a consequence of a simple observation that one can use the solution of Soergel's conjecture to make ambiguities involved in defining certain morphisms between Soergel bimodules in characteristic zero (double leaves) disappear.

            <br>Joint with <a href="http://math.univ-bpclermont.fr/~riche/">Simon Riche</a>.<br>
            In this paper we apply Treumann's "Smith theory for sheaves" in the context of the Iwahori-Whittaker model of the Satake category. We deduce two results in the representation theory of reductive algebraic groups over fields of positive characteristic: (a) a geometric proof of the linkage principle; (b) a character formula for tilting modules in terms of the p-canonical basis, valid in all blocks and in all characteristics.

            We prove a character formula for simple modules for reductive algebraic groups in characteristic <i>p</i> in terms of the <i>p</i>-canonical basis in the periodic module (which we also define).

            The Hecke category is emerging as a fundamental object in representation theory. We give a motivated introduction to this category in both its geometric
        (via parity sheaves) and diagrammatic (generators and relations) incarnations.
        We also discuss the p-canonical basis and Koszul duality for the Hecke

            It is an interesting question as to how non-perverse parity sheaves can be.
            One might hope that there are none on type A flag varieties, but this is not the case. This paper gives an example for <i>p</i> = 2.
            McNamara has recently found examples for all primes. I suspect that one also has some form of "torsion explosion" for non-perversity,
            but can't prove this (despite some effort).

            We establish modular Koszul duality relating parity and tilting
            sheaves on the flag variety, and deduce a character formula for
            indecomposable tilting sheaves. This gives a proof of the
            combinatorial part of the conjecture with Riche in "Tilting
            modules and the <i>p</i>-canonical basis" below. Another
            remarkable consequence is that the Hecke category of a (Kac-Moody)
            flag variety "knows" the Hecke category of the Langlands dual flag variety.

            Tilting modules for algebraic groups are fascinating and
            mysterious objects. Understanding their characters for GLn is equivalent
            to understanding decomposition numbers for symmetric groups. In
            this paper we advocate a "generational philosophy" for attacking
            this problem, and formulate a precise conjecture for SL3. Remarkably, these characters appear to be governed by a
            discrete dynamical system, that looks like billiards bouncing in
            equilateral triangles!<br>

            This is part of a big project to understand Koszul duality in the
            modular context. A first goal is a proof of a character formula for
            tilting modules in terms of the
            <i>p</i>-canonical basis, which was conjectured with Riche (see
            our tilting manifesto below). Here we define a category which is
            an algebraic version of "free monodromic tilting sheaves"
            considered by Bezrukavnikov-Yun. We work very hard to show that
            this category has a monoidal structure. In a sequel (to appear
            soon) we use these results to establish modular Koszul duality,
            and prove our character conjecture.

        Clasically, one considers the anti-spherical (or "polynomial")
        module for the affine Hecke algebra. We explain how to categorify its natural
        analogue for any Coxeter group using diagrammatics and Soergel
        calculus. In doing so we prove that (signed) parabolic
        Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials have non-negative coefficients. Much
        of our motivation for studying this category in detail comes from
        my joint work with S. Riche on tilting modules (see below).

  <br>Joint with <a href="http://math.univ-bpclermont.fr/~riche/">Simon Riche</a>, Astérisque 2018, no. 397.<br>
  Our manifesto on tilting modules: we conjecture that the (diagrammatic) Hecke category acts
  on the principal block via wall-crossing functors. We prove our conjecture for the general
  linear group using the theory of 2-Kac-Moody actions. Remarkably (for me) the conjecture
  allows one to completely describe the principal block in terms of the Hecke category.
   As a corollary we derive character formulas for simple and tilting modules in terms of the <i>p</i>-canonical basis. This
  paper also ties up a few loose ends, including proving that the diagrammatic Hecke category
  has an alternative geometric realisation via parity sheaves.

  In geometric situations Soergel bimodules can be realised
  as the equivariant intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties,
  and hence have interesting real Hodge theory (hard Lefschetz,
  Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations etc). Inspired by work of de Cataldo
  and Migliorini giving Hodge theoretic proofs of the decomposition
  theorem 
  we prove that these Hodge theoretic properties always
  hold for Soergel bimodules, whether they come from Schubert varieties or not!
  This gives structures strong enough to deduce Soergel's
  conjecture, and hence the Kazhdan-Lusztig positivity conjecture. The result can also be used to give the first algebraic proof
  of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjectures on characters of simple highest weight
  modules over complex semi-simple Lie algebras.

  We give a counterexample to the most optimistic analogue of the
  James conjecture for simply laced Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier
  algebras. The basic idea is to recycle counterexamples known for
  Schubert varieties (due mostly to Braden and Polo). The bridge is

  the characteristic variety, using work of Kashiwara and Saito and a

  irreducible; Kleshchev-Ram's conjecture that decomposition numbers
  for for KLR algebras are trivial in finite type; various people's
  hopes that stalks and costalks of IC sheaves on flag varieties have

  topological side (a decomposition number is non-trivial)
  implies the analytic side (the characteristic variety is
  reducible). This is a consequence of the trivial observation that the

  The 2-braid group is a categorification of the braid group. It has
  been around for a few decades in highest weight representation
  theory (long before it acquired a name). A few years ago Khovanov showed
  that it may be used to construct HOMFLYPT homology, and since then
  there has been growing interest in its type A incarnation. Rouquier
  has emphasised that a study of the morphisms in the 2-braid group
  should have many applications in representation theory (new proofs
  of Kazhdan-Lusztig type conjectures, understanding of t-structures
  in modular representation theory, construction of Spetses, etc.) In
  this paper we make a first step in the study of morphisms spaces in
  2-braid groups, namely we consider "standard" and
  "costandard" objects and show that they satisfy a vanishing
  condition conjectured by Rouquier.

  Singular Soergel bimodules is a interesting 2-category
  which acts (or should act) in many representation theoretic
  situations. It also has an elementary definition in terms of certain
  rings of invariants, for the action of a Coxeter system on a
  polynomial ring. In this paper we classify the indecomposable
  singular Soergel bimodules, and prove that it categorifies the Schur
  algebroid, a natural algebroid
  generalising the Hecke algebra of a Coxeter system.

  A moment graph is a labelled graph which encodes the
  ``one-skeleton'' of certain algebraic torus actions on varieties. It
  is an amazing fact (usually referred to as the localisation
  theorem) that one can recover a lot of cohomological information
  about a variety from its moment graph. In this paper we show that
  the moment graph can be used to calculate the stalks of ``parity
  sheaves'' (see below). We use  this result, together with an
  algebraic result of Fiebig, to deduce the p-smooth locus of Schubert
  varieties. We also apply this to representation theory and show that
  moment graphs can be used to calculate the weight spaces of tilting
  modules.

  We show that the Jones-Ocneanu trace on the Hecke algebra of type
  A evaluated on a Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element is a mixed Poincare
  polynomial of the B-conjugation equivariant cohomology of the
  corresponding intersection cohomology complex. This then gives a
  natural trace on Hecke algebras of finite type. We then show that
  this trace is equal to a trace defined by Gomi in 2006. This yields
  a simple geometric proof of Gomi's result, and provides a natural
  framework in which to interpret his definition. Another useful (and
  unexpected) biproduct of our investigations is a proof that the 
  Hochschild homology of Soergel bimodules in
  finite type is free. (This had been observed previous by Rasmussen
  in Type A, but his proof doesn't generalise.)

 We introduce a new class of sheaves on certain
  varieties (the "parity sheaves") which we believe will be
 fundamental in attempts to use modular perverse sheaves in
 representation theory. We show that one may prove a decomposition
  theorem type result for certain maps (which we call "even"), and
  show the role played by certain intersection forms introduced in
  work of de Cataldo and Migliorini in determining the stalks of
  parity sheaves. We also give lots of examples. Probably the most
  important being that parity sheaves exist on the affine
  Grassmannian, and (under some moderate assumptions)
  correspond to tilting modules.

  This paper continues Ben and my efforts to understand various link
  homology theories geometrically, in terms of constructible
  sheaves. We are primarily interested in Khovanov and Rozansky's
  triply graded HOMFLYPT homology, and a natural first question is
  what on earth do all the gradings mean?! The crucial point is that,
  on a non-proper algebraic variety one has a weight filtration before
  and after pushing to a point, which may be used to construct a triple
  grading. In this way we obtain a completely geometric construction
  of HOMFLYPT homology, as well as various  "colored"
  generalisations.

We give an overview of three applications of perverse sheaves in
modular representation theory. The basic idea is to consider sheaves of
    <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>-vector spaces on complex
algebraic varieties, where k is a field of positive characteristic. The
corresponding categories of perverse sheaves behave like (and sometimes
are actually equivalent to) categories arising in modular
representation theory. Just as is the case for modular representations,
these categories are difficult to understand. In order to try to
convince the reader of this we give some calculations on nilpotent
cones: things are already very interesting in sl_n for n = 2, 3 and 4! <br>

For a fixed field <i>k</i> of positive characteristic

varieties with coefficients in <i>k</i>. In this article we present a
combinatorial algorithm which, if successful, proves that they ''look
the same'' as in characteristic 0. Our algorithm relies on the W-graph
for which no general description is known. Thus we can only apply our
techniques in small rank. Thanks
to results of Soergel, we are able to conclude parts of the Lusztig
conjecture on modular representations of reductive groups.<br>
  In the appendix, Tom Braden gives some examples of torsion in the

Khovanov
has constructed a knot invariant in the homotopy category of bigraded
modules over a polynomial ring. This involves first constructing a
complex of Soergel bimodules and then taking Hochschild homology. In
this paper we show that all of this may be interpreted geometrically:
each term in the complex may be viewed is the equivariant cohomology of
a ''Bott-Samelson'' type space, and the maps in the complex are induced
from maps between Bott-Samelson varieties. Using geometric techniques
we are also able to give explicit descriptions of the Hochschild
homology of certain ''smooth'' Soergel bimodules in type A.<br>

This is my PhD thesis. It defines singular Soergel bimodules in a
general framework and classifies the indecomposable bimodules (generalising
results of Soergel). Soergel bimodules and their singular variants have
many applications (including the study of category O, equivariant
perverse sheaves and knots) and the list will probably grow in the
future. One exciting possibility is a tensor category of bimodules
which is equivalent to the representation ring of an (adjoint)
semi-simple group.<br>
